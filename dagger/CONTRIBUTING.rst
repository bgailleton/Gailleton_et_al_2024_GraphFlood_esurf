Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways, but I still need to implement the standardisation of the loosely connected interfaces and the documentation before writing the guidelines here.

Contact me if interested though!
